I assume the following:
Assumes groups don't want to be split
Assumes we only separate by 3 seats and not entire rows unless we have a low amount of customers
Assumes people like the back more

Features:
Error prevention inputs
Allows customers to rebook
Allows dynamic sized theaters and buffers
FIFO
Greedy algorithm for placement
Skips large groups that wouldn't fit to allow smaller groups to fit
