# MovieTheaterSeating

I assume the following:

* Assumes groups don't want to be split

* Assumes we only separate by 3 seats and not entire rows unless we have a low amount of customers

* Assumes people like the back more


Features:
* Error prevention inputs

* Allows customers to rebook

* Allows dynamic sized theaters and buffers

* FIFO

* Greedy algorithm for placement

* Skips large groups that wouldn't fit to allow smaller groups to fit

How to run:
* Find main.py and run `python main.py <location of input.txt>` in terminal

or

* Find main.py and run `python main.py` in terminal and then paste location of input.txt
